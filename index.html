     Illumination" this is what the meaning my name signifies. 
     As the meaning of my name is symptomatic of , I am the person who illuminates  whatever
     the exertion she does. I am passionate , sedulous and optimistic person. I always bring
     out the positive side from any negative segment and give my best shot to that positive
     side by working meticulously with right amount of positive attitude to turn the table
     from negative segment to positive persona.
     In perpetuity I acquit the task given to me in a messianic with self-motivated mind 
     along with all the enthusiasm which bring out the tonality in my work. I am smart enough
     to get engage myself in task to give prominence to the task to flourish it.
     I believe until and unless anything is not rejoiced with being a keen observer while 
     getting engaged into it , the best from anything cannot be accomplished successfully.
